# Data|FInance|BI Analyst

### About Me
Hi, I’m Brenda — a data analyst with a background in Electrical and Control Engineering.

My engineering foundation sharpened my skills in problem-solving, system thinking, and interpreting technical data — all of which now power my transition into data analytics.

I first applied these skills on the **National Agricultural Value Chain Development Project (NAVCDP)**, where I was responsible for collecting and organizing field data. One highlight was helping detect fake fertilizer cases through accurate data collection — an experience that revealed the real-world impact of quality data.

Today, I specialize in:
- **SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau**
- Data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling
- Transforming raw data into actionable insights

I’ve completed the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** and built a portfolio of hands-on projects covering customer segmentation, business dashboards, and web scraping.

During my free time, I’m driven by curiosity and continuous learning. I love building data-driven projects, exploring analytics trends, and applying engineering discipline to solve real-world challenges.

 **I'm actively seeking remote  roles in data analytics. If you're looking for a passionate, analytical, and results-driven team member — let's connect!**
