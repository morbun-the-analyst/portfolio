# Data Analyst

### About Me

Hi, I’m Brenda! My passion for data analytics stems from my background in Electrical and Control Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, data interpretation, and analytical thinking. My ability to break down complex systems and analyze technical data has been instrumental in my transition to data analytics.

I first applied these skills while working on the National Agricultural Value Chain Development Project (NAVCDP), where I was responsible for collecting and organizing agricultural data. Ensuring data accuracy and reliability was crucial in detecting fake fertilizer instances, which sparked my curiosity about how data can drive meaningful decisions.

To build my expertise, I specialized in data analytics and gained proficiency in SQL, Python, and data visualization (Tableau). Now, I’m focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights through personal projects that enhance my analytical and technical skills.

Beyond work, I enjoy building data-driven projects, staying updated on analytics trends, and continuously improving my skills. My engineering background also taught me the importance of continuous learning, precision, and structured problem-solving—traits I bring to every data challenge.

I’m actively looking for opportunities in data analytics where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems. If you’re looking for a dedicated and analytical problem-solver, let’s connect!
